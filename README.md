*This is just an experiment*, not scientific work, with important flaws.
Country boundaries have evolved in that period of time (see [this page](./changements) for a broad list), the actual (2015) state is used as a reference.
This is a UE+Switzerland selection of countries. Some islands are not drawn (sorry, Corsica). Boundaries are simplified.

This visualisation uses:
- a [web-worker / node fork]() of [cartogram.js](http://prag.ma/code/d3-cartogram/) to reshape countries
- [D3.js](http://d3js.org/), and is inspired by [Force-Directed States of America](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1073373)
- [miso dataset](http://misoproject.com/dataset/)
- react for everything except the map
